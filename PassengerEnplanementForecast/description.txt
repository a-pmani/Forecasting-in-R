Everyone is locked down in 2020 and the Travel industry is one amongst the many others which has taken a bad hit. U.S. travel and tourism made up approx. 2.8 percent of GDP and was worth approx. $2 trillion till 2019. COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented crisis for the tourism industry. Both domestic and international travels have ceased as national borders are closed and being at home is the new normal. Trends in travel for work and leisure have seen a drastic plunge in the year 2020. We further assume that travel is not likely to return to pre-crisis levels until at least a couple of more years.
Through this project we wanted to explore historic travel data for both domestic and international travel based out of the USA and predict the passenger numbers in flight for the coming 7 months.
