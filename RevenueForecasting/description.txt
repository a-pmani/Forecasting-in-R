FORECASTING WALMARTâ€™S REVENUE 
Nature of the data: 
Plotting the time series data generated by the ts function, help us visualize the trend and seasonality. 
  By looking at the Quarterly revenue from 2005 Q1 to 2020 Q2 plot, we can see that the data has an upward trend and seasonality present.    
  The revenue goes up in Q2, sees a dip in Q3 and eventually peaking in Q4. This behavior keeps repeating over the course of the time taken 
  into consideration. In order to understand the components of the time series data better, we can use the autoplot function in R to plot the 
  different components individually. The Walmart quarterly revenue series components plot helps us visualize the trend and seasonality separately. 
  In this plot we can clearly see the seasonal behavior of the revenue data clearly, Q2 and Q4 showing peaks in revenue and a dip in Q3. 
    The overall upward trend is also clearly visible. 
    The remainder component is the remaining variation between the time series and the combination of trend and seasonal component. 
    The remainder is showing periods of random variations across quarters of each year.

Techniques used:
    i. Regression model with linear trend
   ii. Regression mode with quadratic trend
  iii. Regression model with seasonality
   iv. Regression model with linear trend and seasonality
    v. Regression model with quadratic trend and seasonality.
