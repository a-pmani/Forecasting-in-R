<h1 align="center"> Forecasting-in-R </h1> <br>
This project aims to forecast future values based on historical data using R programming language.
Leveraging powerful R packages, I delve into time series analysis, exploring trends, seasonality, and patterns to make accurate predictions.

Time series data preprocessing and visualization.
Application of traditional forecasting methods like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
Utilization of advanced forecasting algorithms such as Facebook Prophet.
Evaluation of forecast accuracy using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Usage
To get started, clone the repository and explore the R scripts provided in the respective directories. 
Run the scripts to see the forecasting techniques in action and experiment with different parameters and models.
